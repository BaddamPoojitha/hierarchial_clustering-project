# hierarchial_clustering-project
Project Title: Analysis and prediction of "mall_customers_csv" of American mall market called as Phonix mall,find out on the basis of clients requirements of dendrograms using scipy graphics library with the help of "scipy.cluster.hierarchy",to ace the no of linkage of the clustering to predict
# Problem Statement:
The American Finance market clients as per the rate for the GDP of 2011 found as highest no of growth in their business market.

As Datascience enigineer find out which hierarchy cluster gives maximum limkage in upcoming future

# TASK:
1.Import the library and datasets

2.Using the dendogram to find the optimal No.of Clusters.

3.Create the hierarchy model and visualize the cluster with the help of matplot library
